### Hi there, I'm Andrew! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm a software engineer that is currently looking for work. If you'd like to get in touch with me or see my resume, just shoot me an [email](mailto:atsuh0124@gmail.com)! Email is generally the best way to get in touch with me, but my LinkedIn is linked on my bio as well if that works better for you. Currently, I am Atlanta-based, but that is flexible.

This is where you'll find some personal projects that I'm alright with publicizing or plan to develop into something more than just for personal use. There are many scripts that I write to automate small things in my freetime that don't make it here because they're extremely niche and strictly meant for personal use, and likewise, code I write for work doesn't make it here for obvious reasons.

Currently, I am working on a [music practice routine app](https://github.com/atsuh0124/music-practice-routine) that is in the early stages of development. Originally, I was going to just make something small for my own use as someone picking up guitar, but after combing through lots of different apps and being disatisfied with most of them for various reasons, I thought it might be cool to try and make it a more general purpose tool. If you have any ideas that you'd like to contribute, please send me an email!
