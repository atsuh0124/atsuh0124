### Hi there, I'm Andrew! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm a software engineer currently based in Louisville, KY that is open to relocating to the NYC/Seattle/San Francisco area. If you'd like to get in touch with me or see my resume, just shoot me an [email](mailto:atsuh0124@gmail.com)! My LinkedIn is on my bio as well if that works better for you.

This is where you'll find some personal projects that I'm alright with publicizing or plan to develop into something more than just for my use case. There are many scripts that I write to automate small things or learn new technologies in my freetime that don't make it here because they're extremely niche and strictly meant for personal use, and likewise, code I write for work doesn't make it here for obvious reasons.
