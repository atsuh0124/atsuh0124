### Hi there, I'm Andrew! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm an Atlanta-based software engineer that is currently looking for work. If you'd like to get in touch with me or see my resume, just shoot me an [email](mailto:atsuh0124@gmail.com)! My LinkedIn is on my bio as well if that works better for you.

This is where you'll find some personal projects that I'm alright with publicizing or plan to develop into something more than just for my use case. There are many scripts that I write to automate small things or learn new technologies in my freetime that don't make it here because they're extremely niche and strictly meant for personal use, and likewise, code I write for work doesn't make it here for obvious reasons.

Currently, I am working on a music practice routine app that is in the early stages of development. The idea is that it will email you a practice routine based on some parameters for the instrument that you are learning in order to improve your consistency. I will update this when it is a bit further along.
