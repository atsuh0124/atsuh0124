### Hi there, I'm Andrew! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm a Software Engineer II currently working for the Operations Research group of UPS based in Louisville, KY. I am open to new opportunities and am open to relocating to the NYC/Seattle/San Francisco area. If you'd like to get in touch with me or see my resume, just shoot me an [email](mailto:atsuh0124@gmail.com)! My LinkedIn is on my bio as well if that works better for you.
